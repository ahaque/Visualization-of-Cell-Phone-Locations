Overview
=================
The application is divided into three components: (i) mobile app, (ii) web interface, and (iii) back-end processing. We refer to the phone being monitored as the child phone and the supervisor as the parent. This project successfully identifies school zones, tracks movement speed, and prevents (provides a reminder) that texting while driving is dangerous.

Neat Features Using with Google Maps:
Parents can draw a geofence and be notified if the child's phone moves outside that region.
Phones locations are shown in a line with interval timestamps, indicating movement over time.
A layer for school zones will display circles 2 miles around all schools.Multiple phones (and their paths) can be viewed on the same map.

I. Mobile Application
-------------------
The mobile application is written using J2ME and works on any Java-enabled phone. The mobile application is necessary only for the child phone. The primary purpose of the application is to communicate with our servers. It consists of a menu to view current restrictions in effect. If the child phone has broken a restriction (such as texting between 9am-4pm on a weekday), it will notify the child phone but not completely prevent the action. The action (such as sending a text message) will be logged. Thus, legitmate or emergency uses are allowed.
