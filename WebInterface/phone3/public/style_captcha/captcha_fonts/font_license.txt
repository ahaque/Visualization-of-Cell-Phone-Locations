Fonts by Tom Murphy 7

This is the official version of the license for all the fonts (except where noted). It supercedes any other licenses circulating. 

I am employing a very generous license with these fonts (the way I think most software should be) for a number of reasons. Mainly though, it is because I would be making fonts regardless of whether I was distributing them or not, and because I know that people benefit from the fact that I give them away. I take enough stuff for free and it makes me feel good to know that I am 'giving back'. 

Here is the license. You are free to download and use these fonts without my explicit permission for anything you want, except for the following: 
You may NOT * resell the actual font files (without my written permission and without having to give me something in return). This includes but is not limited to selling it on a Font CD (even when the fee involved is a nominal "distribution" or "handling" fee, or some similar thing), or distributing it on a site which charges a fee per font download. (In contrast, a pay-per-hour service such as America Online is free to distribute the fonts.) 
You may not misrepresent the creator of the font (pretend you made them) 
You may not adapt them to different fonts without my permission. 
You may not modify the font files for subsequent redistribution. 

However, you have permission to do the following: 
Use them to make graphics for your home page, non-profit web page, or commerical web site. 
Give them to your friends for free. 
Make them available (for free) on your web page, as long as you don't pretend you made them. It'd be nice of you to include this README file, too. 
Use them in design work that you get paid for. 
Use them in any smalltime publications or fliers or other non mass-produced literature. 
Make commercial products like T-shirts or Mugs or Books using the fonts and sell them. In this case, since you are indirectly profiting off of my work, I ask that you send me one of the T-shirts or Mugs or Books free, where reasonable . Obviously some discretion on your part is due; but try to be fair. If it is inappropriate for you to send me one of your product, at least make an attempt to write me an e-mail at imightbetm@aol.com and let me know where the font is being used. 

Exception to the above: The fonts (or converted versions of them) may be included on any recognized distribution of the Linux and (Open/Net/Free)BSD operating systems, even if the CD is sold. Please include the readme .

* "Not", as in, "Not without my permission". I regularly give permission for this sort of thing, so if you want to redistribute the fonts for a fee, let me know and we can probably work something out. Generally I simply request a copy of the CD or magazine or whatever.
